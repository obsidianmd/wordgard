//- This module defines an editor component for use in the browser, on
//- top of the editing model defined in the other modules. It _can_ be
//- loaded outside the browser, but won't do anything useful there.

//- ### Editor Component

//- The {@link Wordgard} class is responsible for displaying an editor
//- interface and the document inside of it. It captures basic user
//- events, such as typing and pointer clicks, and converts them into
//- editing actions.

export {Wordgard} from "./editor"

//- ### Key Bindings

//- Functionality used for binding keys to editing commands.

export {KeyBinding} from "./keymap"

//- ### Decoration

//- Decorations provide a way to influence the way the document is
//- displayed without changing the document itself, via editor
//- extensions. They are useful for showing out-of-band information or
//- editing controls directly in the editable content.

export {Decoration, Widget} from "./decoration"

//- ### Panels

//- Panels are interface elements displayed above or below the editor.
//- They use sticky positioning to stay in view even when the editor
//- is partially scrolled out of view. They are a good way to display
//- things like dialogs, status bars, and menu bars.

export {Panel} from "./panel"
export {menuBar} from "./menubar"
export {Dialog} from "./dialog"

//- ### Tooltips

//- Tooltips are small elements displayed over the editor near a
//- specific document position.

export {Tooltip} from "./tooltip"

//- ### Utilities

//- Input rules are a way to respond to certain patterns of text input
//- with an action, such as replacing sequences of dashes with emdash
//- characters or automatically creating lists when a textblock is
//- started with a number and a period.

export {InputRule} from "./inputrule"

export {placeholder} from "./placeholder"

export {dropCursor} from "./dropcursor"
