//- This module exports abstractions to represent editor commands,
//- which represent user actions, as well as a collection of commands
//- and supporting functions.

//- ### Command Abstraction

//- Commands functions are used by things like key bindings, menus,
//- and event handlers to dispatch a specific type of user action.
//- They have a parameter type (which may be null and ignored).

export {Command} from "./command"

//- ### Menu System

//- A set of abstractions used to define generic menu items and
//- structure. This does not include an actual implementation of a
//- menu component. For that, see {@link editor.menuBar}.

export {Menu} from "./menu"

//- ### Basic Editing Commands

//- Commands for fundamental editing actions.

export {
  insertText,
  insertLineBreak,
  enter,
  transposeChars,
  undo,
  redo
} from "./commands"

//- ### Selection Commands

//- Commands that move the selection. Most take an `extend` flag that
//- controls whether they move or extend the selection.

export {
  moveByUnit,
  moveByWord,
  moveByLine,
  moveByPage,
  moveToLineSide,
  moveToTextblockSide,
  moveToDocSide,
  selectAll,
} from "./commands"

//- ### Deletion Commands

//- Commands that delete content.

export {
  deleteUnit,
  deleteWord,
  deleteToLineEnd,
  deleteLine,
} from "./commands"

//- ### Block Manipulation Commands

//- Commands that act on the document's block structure.

export {
  setTextblockType,
  unwrapBlock,
  wrapBlock,
  toggleBlock,
  setAlignment,
  setDirection,
  toggleList,
} from "./commands"

//- ### Inline Mark Commands

//- Commands that toggle inline marks.

export {
  toggleMark,
  toggleEmphasis,
  toggleStrong,
  toggleUnderline,
} from "./commands"

//- ### Utility Functions

//- Functions that may be useful when implementing your own commands.

export {
  listIsActive,
} from "./commands"

  liftEmptyBlock,
  splitTextblock,
  deleteSelection,
